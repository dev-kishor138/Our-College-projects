                <h3>We are Front End Web Developer.</h3>
                <p>We started the journey of Diploma in Engineering life in 2018 at Rangpur Polytechnic Institute in 2018-19 session.  We are all second shift students of Computer Science and Technology.  We studied in Rangpur Polytechnic Institute for seven long semesters.  The teachers of the institute have analyzed all the topics very well step by step from the beginning to the end of our computer.  As a result we acquire special knowledge about computer science and technology. <br><br>  Every semester we complete the academic studies well and gain proper knowledge about various computer topics in practical classes.  For example, we acquire knowledge of computer hardware and software.  Hardware related knowledge includes IT support department.  Here we visually inspect and know about computer RAM, mouse, hard disk, cooling fan, power supply, keyboard etc.  Besides, among the knowledge related to software, we gain special knowledge about website design development.  Then in eighth semester we moved to industrial attachment to gain practical experience</p>

                <p>E-Learning and Earning Limited is the largest IT company in Bangladesh.  It is located in Kalyanpur, the capital city of Dhaka.  We arrived there in October 2022 from Rangpur Polytechnic Institute.  We are blessed to have industrial attachment at E-Learning and Earning Limited.  Because it is the biggest IT organization in Bangladesh.  The institute has well-equipped labs.  Where students can comfortably take classes in a pleasant environment and learn more about the subject of their attachment. <br> <br> Moreover, we did not have to worry about accommodation as this institution has its own hostel.  The trainers of this organization are very experienced.  They gave us a complete understanding of website design and development and if any problem arose while working, they solved and explained it very precisely to us.  As a result of which we can now create a complete website. Then in January 2023 we came back to Rangpur Polytechnic Institute and learned more about website design and development.</p>
